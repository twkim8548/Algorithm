### 문제 설명

<p>Many years ago, people were struggling with 6 hours extra that every year has. They decided to do calculate the 6 hours and keep every year as 365 days. The direct consequence of that calculation happened to the starting point of the new year. For example, they had a new year in winter, summer, fall, or spring. To fix the new years’ time, they decided to add extra day after every 4 years and they called it a leap year and keep the other 3 years 365 days. Your job is to write a program to find what are leap years in the given years.</p>
