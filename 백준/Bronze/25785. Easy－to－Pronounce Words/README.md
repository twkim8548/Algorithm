### 문제 설명

<p>We define a word as easy-to-pronounce if every vowel in the word is immediately followed by a consonant and every consonant in the word is immediately followed by a vowel. The first letter of the word can be a vowel or consonant. Assume that the vowels are: a, e, i, o, u (note that the letter y is not a vowel, i.e., it is a consonant).</p>

<p>Given a word, print 1 (one) if it is easy-to-pronounce, 0 (zero) otherwise.</p>
