<p>A rectangular cake is transported via a truck to a restaurant. On the way to the destination, the truck hits a pothole, which shatters the cake in N perfectly rectangular pieces of width w<sub>i</sub> and length l<sub>i</sub>, for 1 ≤ i ≤ N.</p>

<p>At the destination, the damage is assessed, and the customer decides to order a replacement cake of the same dimensions. Unfortunately, the original order form was incompletely filled and only the width W of the cake is known. The restaurant asks for your help to find out the length L of the cake. Fortunately, all pieces of the shattered cake have been kept.</p>
