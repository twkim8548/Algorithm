### 문제 설명

<p>There are several proposals for converting a cat’s age to human age. One such approach is as follows:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
	<li>The first year of cat’s age is equivalent to 15 years of human age.</li>
	<li>The second year of cat’s age is equivalent to 9 years of human age.</li>
	<li>Every year after the second year of cat’s age is equivalent to 4 years of human age.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, if a cat is 13-year old, the cat would be {(15) + (9) + [(13 – 2) * 4)]} = 68-year old in human age. Note that the above approach implies:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
	<li>If a cat is less than one-year old, each month of cat’s age will be equivalent to 15 months of human age. For example, if a cat is 5-month old, the cat would be (5 * 15) = 75-month old in human age, which is 6-year-and-3-month old.</li>
	<li>If a cat is older than one year but less than two-year old, each month of cat’s age after the first year will be equivalent to 9 months of human age. For example, if a cat is 1-year-and7-month old, the cat would be {(15 years) + [(7 * 9) months]} = {(15 years) + [63 months]} = 20-year-and-3-month old in human age.</li>
	<li>If a cat is beyond 2-year old, each month of cat’s age after the second year will be equivalent to 4 months of human age. For example, if a cat is 5-year-and-7-month old, the cat would be {(15 years) + (9 years) + [(5 – 2) * 4 years] + [(7 * 4) months]} = 38-yearand-4-month old in human age.</li>
</ol>

<p>Given a cat’s age, convert it to human age.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>There is only one input line; it contains two integers: y (0 ≤ y ≤ 20), indicating the year part of the cat’s age and m (0 ≤ m ≤ 11), indicating the month part of the cat’s age.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print two integers indicating the cat’s age in human age (years and months). Note that the output value for months should not exceed 11.</p>
