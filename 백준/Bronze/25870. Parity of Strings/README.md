### 문제 설명

<p>The historical battle between numbers and strings has taken a new twist: numbers are bragging on their categorization of being “even” or “odd” and strings lacking such feature. But don’t count strings out yet!</p>

<p>A string is considered “even” if every letter in the string appears an even number of times; the string is “odd” if every letter in the string appears an odd number of times.</p>

<p>Given a string, determine whether the string is even, odd, or neither.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input consists of a single line, starting in column 1, not exceeding column 70, and containing only the lowercase letters (at least one letter).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The output consists of a single integer: print 0 (zero) if the string is even, 1 (one) if the string is odd, or 2 if the string is not even and is not odd (i.e., it is neither).</p>
