### 문제 설명

<p>In an attempt to get herself fit, a friend of mine has bought herself a pedometer. She wears it when walking and it tells her how far she has walked.</p>

<p>The pedometer is sensitive to movement and is able to count steps reasonably accurately. Before using it, users have to measure the length of a pace and enter it into the pedometer, which can then use it to show how far has been walked. In this problem, you have to do this calculation.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>You will be given data for several pedometer users and asked to calculate how far each has walked. The first line of input for a person is a single integer L (10 < L < 100) which gives the stride length, in centimetres, of the person using the pedometer. This will be 0 for the last person whose data is not to be processed.</p>

<p>The next line for each user is a single integer N (1 <= N <=100) which is the number of entries for this person. N lines then follow, each containing a single positive integer no greater than 20,000. This is the number of steps the user has taken for the time period in question.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each user shown in the input, begin output with a single line of the format</p>

<pre>User U</pre>

<p>where U is the user number. Users are numbered from 1 in the order they appear in the input. This is followed by N lines, one for each entry showing the number of steps, which shows the appropriate distance walked in kilometers. This will be in the format</p>

<pre>d.ddddd</pre>

<p>ie at least one number before the decimal point and exactly 5 after it.</p>
