### 문제 설명

<p>We’re all familiar with harshad numbers. For this problem, you will ... what’s that? You aren’t familiar with harshad numbers? They’re also known as Niven numbers – does that ring a bell?? Anything???</p>

<p>Well, it’s a simple enough concept. A harshad number is a number which is evenly divisible by the sum of its digits. For example, 24 is a harshad number: the sum of its digits is 2 + 4 = 6 and 24 is divisible by 6. 156 is also a harshad number, since 1 + 5 + 6 = 12 and 156 = (12)(13). 157 is NOT a harshad number since it is not divisible by 1 + 5 + 7 = 13.</p>

<p>OK, let’s start over.</p>

<p>We’re all familiar with harshad numbers. For this problem, you will be given a number n and must find the smallest harshad number ≥ n.</p>
