### 문제 설명

<p>You are getting ready to take a final exam for your Basket Weaving 101 class and you need to know the minimum score you must get on the final exam in order to obtain an average of at least 90 for the course. A weighted average consists of a number of scores along with their respective weights. For this course, there are four parts to the grade, a project that is worth 15% of the grade, a term paper that is worth 20% of the grade, a midterm exam that is worth 25% of the grade, and a final exam that worth 40% of the grade. Given scores for the project, the term paper, and the midterm exam, compute and display the minimum integer final exam score that will result in a grade of at least 90 for the course. Possible final exam scores range from 0 to 100, inclusive. If it is impossible to obtain at least 90 your program should display the appropriate message.</p>
