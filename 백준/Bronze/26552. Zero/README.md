### 문제 설명

<p>You’re writing the positive integers in increasing order starting from one. But you’ve never learned the digit zero, and thus omit any number that contains a zero in any position. The first ten integers you write are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11. You have just written down the integer k (which is guaranteed to not contain the digit zero). What will be the next integer that you write down?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line will contain a single integer n that indicates the number of data sets that follow. Each data set will consist of a single line containing the integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 999,999). It is guaranteed that k does not contain the digit zero.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each data set print, on a single line, the next integer you will be writing down.</p>
