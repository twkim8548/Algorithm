### 문제 설명

<p>Arild just turned 1 year old, and is currently learning how to count. His favorite thing to count is how many mouthfuls he has in a meal: every time he gets a bite, he will count it by saying the number out loud.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, talking while having a mouthful sometimes causes Arild to mumble incomprehensibly, making it hard to know how far he has counted. Sometimes you even suspect he loses his count! You decide to write a program to determine whether Arild’s counting makes sense or not.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000), the number of bites Arild receives. Then second line contains n space-separated words spoken by Arild, the i’th of which is either a non-negative integer a<sub>i</sub> (0 ≤ a<sub>i</sub> ≤ 10 000) or the string “mumble”.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>If Arild’s counting might make sense, print the string “makes sense”. Otherwise, print the string “something is fishy”.</p>
