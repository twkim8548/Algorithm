### 문제 설명

<p>Gru has been trying to teach the minions English (they are born knowing only Minionese, which Lucy can’t stand). He is currently stuck trying to teach them the difference between vowels and consonants, which the minions are always confused about, especially “y”, which they argue about endlessly (it is not a vowel). To help them practice, Gru starts a contest where the minions have to count the number of vowels in a word, i.e., given a word, they have to tell Gru what is the number of vowels in it. The winner gets ice cream, which the minions are crazy about. Kevin the Minion wants your help to cheat and eat a lot of ice cream.</p>

### 입력

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, you are to output the number of vowels in that word. The vowels are: “a”, “e”, “i”, “o”, and “u”. The exact format is shown below in the examples.</p>
