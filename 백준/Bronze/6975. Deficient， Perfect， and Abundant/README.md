### 문제 설명

<p>Write a program that repeatedly reads a positive integer, determines if the integer is deficient, perfect, or abundant, and outputs the number along with its classification.</p>

<p>A positive integer, <var>n</var>, is said to be perfect if the sum of its proper divisors equals the number itself. (Proper divisors include 1 but not the number itself.) If this sum is less that <var>n</var>, the number is deficient, and if the sum is greater than <var>n</var>, the number is abundant.</p>
